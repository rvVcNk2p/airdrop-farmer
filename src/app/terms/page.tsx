										<h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
										<p>
											This Agreement, referred to as the &quot;Terms of
											Use,&quot; establishes the terms and conditions between
											you (referred to as “user”, “you”, and “your”) and Airdrop
											Copilot (”Copilot”, “Company”, “we”, “us”, and “our”). It
											governs your utilization of the services provided by
											Airdrop Copilot, including the Airdrop Farming Bot. By
											engaging with the Copilot Website, you affirm that you
											have comprehensively read, understood, and agreed to abide
											by all the terms and conditions outlined in this
											Agreement.
										</p>

										<p>
											To qualify for the use of Copilot Website and/or
											additional services provided by third parties and
											accessible through Copilot Website, you must be a resident
											of a country where the relevant services are supported.
											Additionally, you must be at least 18 years old or, if
											higher, the age of majority in your country of residence.
											We reserve the right to make amendments to this Agreement
											periodically. In such cases, we will publish the updated
											Agreement on the Website and specify the revision date at
											the top of this page. Your ongoing use of the Copilot
											Website following any modifications constitutes your
											acknowledgment and acceptance of the revised Agreement.
										</p>

											<h1 className="mt-10">THE SERVICE</h1>
											<h2>Purpose of the Website</h2>
										</div>

										<p>
											The Website is provided for the purpose of interacting
											with different contracts on the blockchain through a
											single interface. The service and platform are designed to
											make it easier for people to interact with decentralized
											applications, not by using their interface, but by
											interacting directly with the blockchain only. Copilot
											Website is not meant to provide any financial advice or
											financial benefit. The Company disclaims all liability and
											responsibility arising from any reliance placed on other
											goals such as financial gain or financial advice by you or
											any other visitor to our Website, or by anyone who may be
											informed of any of its contents. Any information you
											provide or that is collected by the Company through the
											Website shall be handled in accordance with the
											Website&apos;s Privacy Policy.
										</p>

										<p>
											Use of the Website. The Company grants you a non-exclusive
											license to access and use the Platform including the
											Website and the data, material, content, or information
											herein (collectively, the “Content”) solely for your
											personal use. Your right to access and use the Website
											shall be limited to the purposes described in these Terms
											unless you are otherwise expressly authorized by the
											Company to use the Website for your own commercial
											purposes. You agree to use the Website only for lawful
											purposes, comply with all rules governing any transactions
											on and through the Website and comply with applicable
											laws.
										</p>

										<h1>Recording Transactions on Public Blockchains</h1>

										<p>
											Transactions that occur on the Platform are managed and
											confirmed using public blockchains, such as the Ethereum
											blockchain. When you make a transaction on the Platform,
											your public address on the relevant blockchain becomes
											visible to the public. We don&apos;t own or control
											MetaMask, other Wallets, Ethereum network, or any other
											blockchain networks we connect with. We also aren&apos;t
											responsible for third-party sites, products, or services
											you use to access Platform features. We aren&apos;t liable
											for the actions of these third parties or any harm you
											face from your transactions or interactions with them.
										</p>

										<h1>Wallet and private key management</h1>

										<p>
											You have full control over the cryptocurrencies stored in
											your wallets connected to Copliot. In the Copilot, your
											private keys are directly stored on your device encrypted.
											You can withdraw your cryptocurrency at any time by
											transferring it to a different blockchain address,
											contingent upon internet access and blockchain congestion.
										</p>

										<h1>Gas Usage</h1>

										<p>
											Smart contracts on blockchain networks handle all Platform
											transactions. These networks typically need a transaction
											fee for each transaction. For instance, the Ethereum
											network demands a fee (&quot;Gas fee&quot;) for all its
											transactions, including those on the Platform. The Gas
											Fee&apos;s value changes and is beyond the Company&apos;s
											control.
										</p>

										<h1>License</h1>

										<p>
											Subject to this Agreement, Airdrop Copilot grants you a
											non-transferable, non-exclusive, revocable, limited
											license to use and access the Service solely for your own
											use, and solely as permitted by and in compliance with the
											Terms and Applicable Law. Such a limited license may be
											revoked at any time in Airdrop Copilot&apos;s sole
											discretion.
										</p>

										<h1>Prohibited Actions</h1>

											others&apos; use of it. Try to access Company accounts,
											systems, or networks without permission. Obtain
											information not intentionally provided by the Company. Use
											automated tools to access or copy Website content.
											Introduce harmful software or engage in denial-of-service
											attacks. Pretend to be the Company, its employees, or
											other users. Sell, distribute, modify, or exploit the
											Service or its content for commercial gain. Tinker with
											the Service&apos;s components, reverse engineer, or create
											similar products. Use the Service to develop competing
											websites, products, or services. You can&apos;t copy,
											distribute, or transmit Service content, except as
											allowed. Any future updates to the Service will also be
											subject to these rules. Copyright and other notices must
											be retained on copies. Your use of the Website and Service
											must be legal.
										</p>

											at any time, with or without notifying users. You
											understand and agree that Airdrop Copilot won&apos;t be

											suspensions, or discontinuations of the Website or any
											part of it.
										</p>

										<h1>No Support or Maintenance</h1>

										<p>
											You understand and agree that Airdrop Copilot isn&apos;t
											obligated to offer you any support or maintenance for the
											Website or Services.
										</p>

										<h1>Cancellation and Refund</h1>

										<p>
											Once a purchase is completed, it cannot be canceled or
											reversed. All purchases are considered final, and refunds
											are not possible once the cryptocurrency has been
											transferred to the specified cryptocurrency wallet. Once a
											purchase has been dispatched to the indicated
											cryptocurrency wallet, it cannot be revoked or recovered
											under any circumstances. Upon delivery, you acknowledge
											and agree that no credit or refund will be provided, and
											all purchases are deemed final. Copilot obligations to you
											are fulfilled upon product delivery, and no claims or
											rights against Copilot are valid thereafter.
										</p>

										<h1>Account Suspension</h1>

										<p>
											You agree that the Company can suspend or terminate your
											access to the Services, Website, and Platform if the
											Company believes, in its sole judgment, that you&apos;re
											using your account for illegal activities, fraud, or
											transactions that violate these Terms of Use.

											The content presented on the Copilot website should not be
											considered as investment advice, financial guidance,
											trading recommendations, or any form of information upon
											which a user should rely when making investment decisions.

											diligence before making any investment.

											the Copilot social media pages should be construed as a
