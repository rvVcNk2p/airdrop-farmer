										<p>
											This Agreement, referred to as the &quot;Terms of
											Use,&quot; establishes the terms and conditions between
											you (referred to as “user”, “you”, and “your”) and Airdrop
											Copilot (”Copilot”, “Company”, “we”, “us”, and “our”). It
											governs your utilization of the services provided by
											Airdrop Copilot, including the Airdrop Farming Bot. By
											engaging with the Copilot Website, you affirm that you
											have comprehensively read, understood, and agreed to abide
											by all the terms and conditions outlined in this
											Agreement.
										</p>

										<p>
											To qualify for the use of Copilot Website and/or
											additional services provided by third parties and
											accessible through Copilot Website, you must be a resident
											of a country where the relevant services are supported.
											Additionally, you must be at least 18 years old or, if
											higher, the age of majority in your country of residence.
											We reserve the right to make amendments to this Agreement
											periodically. In such cases, we will publish the updated
											Agreement on the Website and specify the revision date at
											the top of this page. Your ongoing use of the Copilot
											Website following any modifications constitutes your
											acknowledgment and acceptance of the revised Agreement.
										</p>

										<div>
											<h1 className="my-8 text-[2rem]">THE SERVICE</h1>
											<h2 className="text-[1.5rem]">Purpose of the Website</h2>
										</div>

										<p>
											The Website is provided for the purpose of interacting
											with different contracts on the blockchain through a
											single interface. The service and platform are designed to
											make it easier for people to interact with decentralized
											applications, not by using their interface, but by
											interacting directly with the blockchain only. Copilot
											Website is not meant to provide any financial advice or
											financial benefit. The Company disclaims all liability and
											responsibility arising from any reliance placed on other
											goals such as financial gain or financial advice by you or
											any other visitor to our Website, or by anyone who may be
											informed of any of its contents. Any information you
											provide or that is collected by the Company through the
											Website shall be handled in accordance with the
											Website&apos;s Privacy Policy.
										</p>

										<p>
											Use of the Website. The Company grants you a non-exclusive
											license to access and use the Platform including the
											Website and the data, material, content, or information
											herein (collectively, the “Content”) solely for your
											personal use. Your right to access and use the Website
											shall be limited to the purposes described in these Terms
											unless you are otherwise expressly authorized by the
											Company to use the Website for your own commercial
											purposes. You agree to use the Website only for lawful
											purposes, comply with all rules governing any transactions
											on and through the Website and comply with applicable
											laws.
										</p>

										<h1 className="text-[1.5rem]">
											Recording Transactions on Public Blockchains
										</h1>

										<p>
											Transactions that occur on the Platform are managed and
											confirmed using public blockchains, such as the Ethereum
											blockchain. When you make a transaction on the Platform,
											your public address on the relevant blockchain becomes
											visible to the public. We don&apos;t own or control
											MetaMask, other Wallets, Ethereum network, or any other
											blockchain networks we connect with. We also aren&apos;t
											responsible for third-party sites, products, or services
											you use to access Platform features. We aren&apos;t liable
											for the actions of these third parties or any harm you
											face from your transactions or interactions with them.
										</p>

										<h1 className="text-[1.5rem]">
											Wallet and private key management
										</h1>

										<p>
											You have full control over the cryptocurrencies stored in
											your wallets connected to Copliot. In the Copilot, your
											private keys are directly stored on your device encrypted.
											You can withdraw your cryptocurrency at any time by
											transferring it to a different blockchain address,
											contingent upon internet access and blockchain congestion.
										</p>

										<h1 className="text-[1.5rem]">Gas Usage</h1>

										<p>
											Smart contracts on blockchain networks handle all Platform
											transactions. These networks typically need a transaction
											fee for each transaction. For instance, the Ethereum
											network demands a fee (&quot;Gas fee&quot;) for all its
											transactions, including those on the Platform. The Gas
											Fee&apos;s value changes and is beyond the Company&apos;s
											control.
										</p>

										<h1 className="text-[1.5rem]">License</h1>

										<p>
											Subject to this Agreement, Airdrop Copilot grants you a
											non-transferable, non-exclusive, revocable, limited
											license to use and access the Service solely for your own
											use, and solely as permitted by and in compliance with the
											Terms and Applicable Law. Such a limited license may be
											revoked at any time in Airdrop Copilot&apos;s sole
											discretion.
										</p>

										<h1 className="text-[1.5rem]">Prohibited Actions</h1>
										<h2>When using the Website, you must not:</h2>

											responsible to you or any third party for such changes,

											part of it.
										</p>

											You understand and agree that Airdrop Copilot isn&apos;t
											obligated to offer you any support or maintenance for the

										</p>

										<h1 className="text-[1.5rem]">Cancellation and Refund</h1>

										<p>
											Once a purchase is completed, it cannot be canceled or
											reversed. All purchases are considered final, and refunds
											are not possible once the cryptocurrency has been
											transferred to the specified cryptocurrency wallet. Once a
											purchase has been dispatched to the indicated
											cryptocurrency wallet, it cannot be revoked or recovered
											under any circumstances. Upon delivery, you acknowledge
											and agree that no credit or refund will be provided, and
											all purchases are deemed final. Copilot obligations to you

											rights against Copilot are valid thereafter.
										</p>

										<h1 className="text-[1.5rem]">Account Suspension</h1>

										<p>
											You agree that the Company can suspend or terminate your

											Company believes, in its sole judgment, that you&apos;re
											using your account for illegal activities, fraud, or
											transactions that violate these Terms of Use.

											AGREEMENT OF RELEASE, INDEMNIFICATION, AND HOLD HARMLESS
										</h1>
										<p>

										</p>

										<h1 className="text-[2rem]">RISK ACCEPTANCE IN AIRDROP</h1>
										<p>
											Absence of Insurance in Airdrop Transactions: Airdrop
											transactions, unlike traditional currency, are not backed
											by legal tender status or government support, and are not
											covered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or
											Securities Investor Protection Corporation safeguards for
											wallet accounts and value balances. Copilot does not
											guarantee the functionality of the Ethereum network or any
											associated dapps, which may result in delays, conflicts of
											interest, or unfavorable operational decisions by third
											parties. These issues could potentially impede your
											ability to complete transactions through the Copilot
											Website. Transaction details submitted via the Copilot
											Website may encounter delays or may not be completed on
											the Ethereum network, with Copilot assuming no
											responsibility for transaction failures or deviations from
											expectations. There are no warranties or guarantees that a
											transfer initiated through Copilot will successfully
											transfer ownership or rights in any cryptocurrency.
										</p>
										<p>
											Lack of Insurance Coverage: It is acknowledged that
											cryptocurrency transactions are not covered by protections
											or insurance provided by the Federal Deposit Insurance
											Corporation or the Securities Investor Protection
											Corporation. As a software provider, Copilot operates
											without regulation from any federal or state regulatory
											agency and is not obligated to undergo examinations or
											comply with reporting requirements imposed by such
											agencies.
										</p>
										<p>
											Acknowledgment of Airdrop and Smart Contract Risks: You
											understand and voluntarily accept the potential risks
											associated with cryptographic systems, including but not
											limited to smart contracts, public blockchain networks
											(such as the Ethereum blockchain network), non-fungible
											tokens (NFTs), and the interplanetary file system.
										</p>
										<p>
											Non-Responsibility for Blockchain Technical Errors: The
											Company cannot be held responsible for technical errors
											occurring on any blockchain. The Company disclaims any
											responsibility for losses stemming from blockchains or any
											other aspects of the Ethereum network or any other
											blockchain network that the Company may interact with.
											This includes interactions with tools such as the Metamask
											wallet or similar browsers or wallets on any blockchain
											network. This disclaimer extends to scenarios like delayed
											reporting by developers or representatives, or even the
											absence of reporting, regarding issues with the blockchain
											supporting the Ethereum network or any other blockchain
											network that the Company may interface with. This
											encompasses events like forks, technical node challenges,
											or any other issues that result in financial losses.
										</p>
										<p>
											Potential Adverse Effects of Upgrades and Changes:
											Upgrades to the Ethereum platform or any other blockchain
											network with which the Company interfaces, as well as hard
											forks or alterations in transaction confirmation
											mechanisms on such platforms, have the potential to lead
											to unintended and unfavorable consequences for all
											blockchains employing the ERC-20, ERC-721, or ERC-1155
											standards.
										</p>
										<p>
											Acknowledgment of Platform Risks: Users acknowledge that
											the Platform is subject to potential flaws and agree that
											the evaluation of any information provided by the Platform
											remains their sole responsibility. This advisory, along
											with other warnings outlined in this Agreement by the
											Company, does not establish or indicate an ongoing
											obligation to continuously apprise you of all conceivable
											risks connected to using or accessing the Platform. The
											Platform may be susceptible to intricate cyber-attacks,
											unforeseen spikes in activity, or other operational or
											technical complications that might lead to interruptions
											or delays on the Platform. Users hereby agree to assume
											the risk of Platform malfunctions arising from unexpected
											or escalated technical challenges, including those
											resulting from advanced attacks, and consent not to hold
											the Company liable for any corresponding losses.
										</p>
										<p>
											Non-Liability for Technical Issues and Attacks: The
											Company shall not assume any liability for any damages or
											interruptions resulting from viruses that may affect your
											computer or other equipment, or for any damages stemming
											from phishing, spoofing, or other malicious attacks.
										</p>
										<p>
											Legal Considerations: In certain jurisdictions,
											limitations or exclusions of liability for incidental or
											consequential damages might not be permissible.
											Consequently, the aforementioned limitation or exclusion
											might not be applicable to you.
										</p>

										<h1 className="text-[2rem]"> TERM AND TERMINATION</h1>
										<p>
											Subject to the terms outlined in this section, this
											Agreement shall remain in full force and effect throughout
											your utilization of the Platform or the Service (the
											&quot;Term&quot;). We reserve the right to suspend or
