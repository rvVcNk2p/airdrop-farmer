			content:
				'By concentrating on developing products, establishing a robust infrastructure, and cultivating a reputable brand, we are poised for greater long-term profitability compared to solely relying on airdrop farming. <br/><br/>The immense potential that arises from fostering trust among individuals and contributing value to the community holds far more significance for us than mere airdrop earnings.',

			content:
				'To be identified as Sybil you need to do four things:<br/>1. Linking addresses engaged in farming the same airdrop among themselves.<br/>2. Sending identical amounts simultaneously to multiple addresses from a centralized exchange (CEX).<br/>3. Conducting multiple airdrop farming using a single wallet.<br/>4. Executing an identical sequence of actions concurrently.<br/><br/>To guarantee your wallets are not identified as Sybil, our system employs a comprehensive randomization process for wallet actions. This means that even wallets within the same cluster will exhibit distinct timings, sequences, and sums, establishing a varied and unforeseeable approach. It is vital on your end to ensure that points 1, 2, and 3 are strictly avoided to prevent any issues.',

In zkSync, computations and much of the data occur off-chain. Since all transactions are verified on the Ethereum mainchain, the security level matches Ethereum. <br/><br/> With substantial funding amounting to $458 million from top investors including Blockchain Capital and Dragonfly Capital, zkSync is set to potentially introduce its own token. Exploring their mainnet could potentially qualify you for an airdrop once their token is launched.',

It acts as an extra boost for any dApp, allowing it to perform large-scale tasks without affecting Ethereum core speed and security. StarkNet secret weapon is its super-strong cryptographic proof system, known as STARK. <br/><br/> Exciting news: StarkNet is gearing up to introduce its very own token. They have set aside 9% of the total token supply for those who have helped build the StarkNet ecosystem – that developers and everyday users who have engaged with StarkNet dApps. Speaking of which, some popular StarkNet dApps include dydx, Immutable, Celer, DeversiFi, Argent, and more. If you have been part of the StarkNet journey by using these dApps before a certain snapshot date, you might just be in line for an airdrop.',

			content:
				'<ul class="text-lg text-main-airdrop pr-6"><li>1. Account Warm-up: To avoid suspicion, consider making small transactions on different networks before joining the airdrop. It is best not to perform all transactions on the same day. Spreading them out over time and across various networks is advisable.</li><br><li>2. Diversify Transactions: Instead of making a high number of transactions in a single day, engage in occasional transactions over time across different networks, including the one offering the airdrop. Activity once a week or every few weeks over several months is recommended.</li><br><li>3. Transaction Volume: Whenever possible, aim to make multiple transactions, with each contributing to your activity. If significant spending is not feasible, aim for an account balance of $1,000 or more. This can enhance your chances of receiving the airdrop and the amount of tokens you are eligible for.</li><br><li>4. Join Project Activities: Participate in project votes using the Snapshot platform, if available. Additionally, engage in events hosted by the project to further increase your involvement.</li></ul>',
