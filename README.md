## How It Works

Set your goals: decide how much you want to transact, pick activities, quantity, and customize extra settings like randomness level. Select a strategy, add private keys, add funds to your wallet, and run the farmer.

## Features

- **1-Click Auto Refill** (in progress): Sit back and relax - we've got it all covered! Just top up your wallet once, and we'll take care of automatically refilling it with native tokens on all farming chains. No more tedious manual work, saving you days of effort.

- **Don't Become a Sybil**: Our system ensures complete randomization of actions performed by your wallets, preventing any possibility of them being identified as Sybil. Each wallet has distinct timings, orders, and amounts, forming a diverse and unpredictable strategy that avoids sybil detection.

- **We Value Your Privacy**: Your privacy is our top priority. We do not store any data about your keys; everything is stored encrypted in your session. Only you have access to your private keys.

## Where to find KEY and PROJECT-UID from `.env`

- [Ankr - Provider](https://rpclist.com/provider/ankr)
- [Supabase - API URL and keys](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/api#api-url-and-keys)
